A key part of our DBA team’s process in testing and preparing for major MySQL version upgrades is comparing query plans using ProxySQL query mirroring. This feature allows us to mirror queries to another cluster / host, by configuring query rules. What makes mirroring particularly useful is the ability to selectively mirror queries based on the query digest, or client user.</description></item><item><title>How to prevent unauthorized users from connecting to ProxySQL</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/30/how-to-prevent-unauthorized-users-from-connecting-to-proxysql/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/30/how-to-prevent-unauthorized-users-from-connecting-to-proxysql/</guid><description>ProxySQL is a great load balancer which however suffers from some shortcomings concerning the management of MySQL users. ProxySQL provides a firewall which, in my case, is not complete enough to properly manage users and secure their access. Indeed, this firewall does not accept subnets and keeps unauthorized connections in ProxySQL. We cannot then be sure of not suffering a DDOS attack on our ProxySQL instance. In this article, I will explain how I managed to overcome this problem.</description></item><item><title>Production with ProxySQL and Orchestrator</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-2-alawi-assaggaf/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-2-alawi-assaggaf/</guid><description> This session was presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.

It isn’t over yet! Next Thursday, June 4th, Percona &amp;amp; ProxySQL are co-hosting the ProxySQL Tech Talks with Percona virtual meetup covering ProxySQL, MySQL and Percona XtraDB Cluster.
The attendees are invited to participate in the two-hour deep-dive event with plenty of time for questions and answers (we will have two 40-minute sessions + 20 minutes allocated for Q&amp;amp;A).</description></item><item><title>MySQL Setup at Hostinger Explained</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/12/11/mysql-setup-hostinger-explained/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2018 15:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/12/11/mysql-setup-hostinger-explained/</guid><description>Ever wondered how hosting companies manage their MySQL database architecture? At Hostinger, we have various MySQL setups starting from the standalone replica-less instances to Percona XtraDB Cluster (later just PXC), ProxySQL routing-based and even absolutely custom and unique solutions which I’m going to describe in this blog post.
We do not have elephant-sized databases for internal services like API, billing, and clients. Thus almost every decision ends up with high availability as a top priority instead of scalability.</description></item></channel></rss>
